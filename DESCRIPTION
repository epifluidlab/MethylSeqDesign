Description: Over the past few year, DNA methylation sequencing has become a popular technology to identify the disease-related methylation alterations. We proposed a novel power calculation and study design procedure, which utilize the information from the pilot data to infer the power with targeted sample size. This procedure includes four steps: differential methylation analysis on pilot data, mixture model fitting on the resulting p values, transformation of Wald test statistics, and smoothing.
