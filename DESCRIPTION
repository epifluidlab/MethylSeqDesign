Description: MethylSeqDesign is a tool for Methyl-Seq power calculation and study design analysis. It controls FDR and calculates power at a genome-wide scale, both sample size (N) and sequencing depth (R) are considered. it takes into account the genome-wide variation of effect size and dispersion by utilizing a pilot data. This tool can calculates genome-wide power(i.e. expected discovery rate(EDR)) given a pilot data, and help you find the optimal N and R combinations for a given budget or a target EDR level.
