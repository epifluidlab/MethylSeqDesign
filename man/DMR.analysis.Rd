\title{Title Differential methylation analysis on pilot data}
\usage{
DMR.analysis(x, cov.matrix, methyl.matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector containing study design information, the number of each element is 
the sample size for each group, the length of x is the number of groups. E.g., if 
there are two groups with equal sample size 5, x=c(5,5)}

\item{cov.matrix}{a matrix of coverage, the rows are genes and columns are samples}

\item{methyl.matrix}{a matrix of methylated read count, the rows are genes and columns are samples.}
}
\value{
a list of two, one is the p values of each gene, the second element is a vector of 
model parameters
