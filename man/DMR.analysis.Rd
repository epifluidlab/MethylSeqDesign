\title{Differential methylation analysis on pilot data}
\usage{
DMR.analysis(N0, cov.matrix, methyl.matrix, prop = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N0}{a numeric vector of length 2 containing sample size of the pilot data, the number of each element is 
the sample size for each group. If the two groups have the same sample size, N0 can be a single numeric value.}

\item{cov.matrix}{a numeric matrix or data frame of coverage, the rows are genes and columns are samples.}

\item{methyl.matrix}{a numeric matrix or data frame  of methylated read count, the rows are genes and columns are samples. A one to one correspondence between the matrix of methylated read count and the matrix of coverage is required.}

\item{prop}{a numeric vector meaning the proportion of subsampling. If you do not want to do subsampling, set prop=1.}
}
\value{
a list of three element, the first element is a vector of p values for each gene, the second element is a matrix of 
model parameters and estimated tagwise dispersion fai. The third element is a matrix of ratios for different prop.
